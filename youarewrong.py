        "Incorrect! It's clear why people don't ask you for help in trivia games.",
        "False! Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, but not you.",
        "Nope! You're like the end pieces of a loaf of bread. Everyone touches you, but nobody wants you.",
        "Wrong! I can't believe you'd get something so simple incorrect. What would your mother say?"
